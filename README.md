## Introduction

The React Weather App allows users to search for weather details of cities and manage their favorite cities for quick access to their weather information. With features like a search bar, adding favorite cities, and removing cities from favorites, users can efficiently stay updated on the weather conditions of their preferred locations.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Search for a city to view its weather details.
- Add favorite cities to quickly access their weather information.
- Remove cities from favorites if no longer needed.

## Features

- Search bar to find weather details of any city.
- Add favorite cities for quick access to their weather information.
- Remove favorite cities when they are no longer needed.
- Optimized rendering using React memoization.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) - React library for fetching and caching asynchronous data.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed superset of JavaScript.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Cascading Style Sheets for styling the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
